    Joseph Bast's and Roy Spencer's piece on scientific consensus regarding climate change acts to undermine faith in science and confuse the public.
    The pursuit of the truth will always carry debate with it, and to hear other perspectives or ideas is critical to the scientific process. But beware that the debate is authentic and not manufactured for political means. To say there's no consensus on climate change is similar to saying there's no consensus that HIV causes AIDS, both of which have little backing and only serve to confuse the public.
    The Petition Project is widely acknowledged to contain both methodological and ethical errors in soliciting signatures, and does little to support the notion that there is a lack of scientific consensus. 
    Do Bast and Spencer imply we should just wait until climate change becomes a verifiable problem that 100% of scientists agree on? And where are all the scientists supporting the notion that climate change is a farce? Where are the supposed swaths of climate change researchers that refute the consensus?
